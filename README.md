# Prime-Numbers

Playing around with different algorithms to find out the first n prime number.
Some of the mechanisms used are simple implementations of Eratosthenes sieve, sundaram algorithm, and square root division.
Tried different containers, mostly vectors (and lists) to see if performance improves.
